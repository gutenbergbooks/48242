<h2 class="i">Preface</h2>
<p>This is a companion volume to the <span class="sc">Prayers
of the Early Church</span>. That little volume has
been started on its way and the editor has
been encouraged to do this one on the <span class="sc">Prayers
of the Middle Ages</span>.</p>
<p>The period covered by these prayers is that of
a thousand years from <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 500 to <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1500.
Generally speaking, the period is from the fall
of Rome to the Reformation. This period was
formerly called the Dark Ages. Evidence of the
lack of light has been found in the lack of material
in some of the centuries. It has been hard
to find any prayers in a few. However, taken
collectively, it is seen that there was much light
that came out of these ages. The Church was
kept alive by those who kept the light burning.
The latter half of this period is now called
the Golden Age of Mysticism.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the prayers is century
by century. There are some questions about
dates of these as well as authorship. The authorities
do not always agree.</p>
<p>We are indebted to many collections of prayers
and to other sources. Some of the books which
have been most valuable are <i>Prayers of the Ages</i>,
compiled by Caroline S. Whitmarsh; <i>Of the
Imitation of Christ; Great Souls at Prayer</i>, arranged
by Mrs. Mary W. Tileston; <i>The Cloud
of Witness</i>, by Hon. Mrs. Gell; <i>Prayers</i>, from
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
the collection of the late Baron Bunsen; <i>A Chain
of Prayer Across the Ages</i>, compiled by Selina
Fitzherbert Fox; <i>Prayers We Love to Pray</i>, arranged
by Edward Leigh Pell; <i>Morning Readings</i>,
compiled by Frank M. Rich; <i>Prayers of the
Saints</i>, by Cecil Headlam; <i>Prayers Ancient and
Modern</i>, compiled by Mary Wilder Tileston;
<i>Ancient Collects</i>, by Rev. William Bright;
<i>Prayers</i>, Massachusetts Council of the Church
Service League; <i>Theologia Germanica</i>; <i>The
Cloud of Unknowing</i>; <i>His Words of Admonition</i>
and <i>Praises of God</i>, by St. Francis of Assisi; <i>Common
Prayers for Family Use</i>, by Westcott.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this little volume is for
individual and family devotions. However, it is
found that prayers like these are read in worship
services, in prayer cells, and prayer meetings.
Young people&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s groups constantly
make use of them. This little book is recommended
for all types of worship services and for
use in church bulletins. Many other ways will
be found to use them.</p>
<p>The editor wishes to acknowledge his deep
debt of gratitude to the late lamented Dr. J.
Minton Batten, professor of church history in
Vanderbilt University, and to Miss Clarice Winstead,
secretary to the editor, for their invaluable
service in compiling this book of prayers.</p>

<h3>For Forgiveness</h3>
<p>O God, whose nature and property is ever to
have mercy and to forgive, receive our humble
petitions; and though we be tied and bound with
the chain of our sins, yet let the pitifulness of
Thy great mercy loose us; for the honour of
Jesus Christ, our Mediator, and Advocate. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Gregory the Great</span></p>
<h3>For Easter Sunday Giving</h3>
<p>O God, who for our redemption didst give
Thine only begotten Son to the death of the
Cross, and by His glorious resurrection hast delivered
us from the power of the enemy, grant
us to die daily to sin, that we may evermore live
with Him, in the joy of His resurrection; through
the same Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Gregory the Great</span></p>
<h3>For Mercy</h3>
<p>O God, the Protector of all that trust in Thee,
without whom nothing is strong, nothing is holy,
increase and multiply upon us Thy mercy; that,
Thou being our Ruler and Guide, we may so
pass through things temporal that we finally lose
not the things eternal. Grant this, O heavenly
Father, for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Gregorian Sacramentary</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3>Collect</h3>
<p>Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open,
all desires known, and from whom no secrets are
hid; cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the
inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly
love Thee, and worthily magnify Thy
holy Name, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Gregorian Sacramentary</span></p>
<h3>For Grace and Power</h3>
<p>O Lord, we beseech Thee mercifully to receive
the prayers of Thy people who call upon Thee;
and grant that they may both perceive and know
what things they ought to do, and also may
have grace and power faithfully to fulfill the
same; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Gregorian Sacramentary</span></p>
<h3>For the World</h3>
<p>Almighty and everlasting God, the Brightness

<h3>For Cleansing</h3>
<p>Almighty and merciful God, the Fountain of
all goodness, who knowest the thoughts of our
hearts, we confess unto Thee that we have sinned
against Thee, and done evil in Thy sight. Wash
us, we beseech Thee, from the stains of our
past sins, and give us grace and power to put
away all hurtful things; so that, being delivered
from the bondage of sin, we may bring forth
worthy fruits of repentance.</p>
<p>O eternal Light, shine into our hearts. O
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
eternal Goodness, deliver us from evil. O eternal
Power, be Thou our support. Eternal Wisdom,
scatter the darkness of our ignorance. Eternal
Pity, have mercy upon us. Grant unto us that
with all our hearts, and minds, and strength,
we may evermore seek Thy face; and finally
bring us, in Thine infinite mercy, to Thy holy
presence. So strengthen our weakness that, following
in the footsteps of Thy blessed Son, we
may obtain Thy mercy, and enter into Thy
promised Joy. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Alcuin</span></p>
<h3>For Illumination</h3>
<p>O most merciful God, incline Thy loving ears

everlasting love, and to attain everlasting joys;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>To Be Set Free</h3>
<p>O God, who art the Author of love, and the
Lover of pure peace and affection, let all who
are terrified by fears, afflicted by poverty, harassed
by tribulation, worn down by illness, be set free
by Thine indulgent tenderness, raised up by
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
amendment of life, and cherished by Thy daily
compassion, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<h3>For a Friend Before a Journey</h3>
<p>O God, who bestowest Thy mercy at all times
on them that love Thee, and in no place art
distant from those that serve Thee; direct the way
of Thy servant in Thy will, that having Thee for
<i>his</i> Protector and Guide, <i>he</i> may walk without
stumbling in the paths of righteousness, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;A Gallican Sacramentary</span></p>
<h3>For Christian Graces</h3>
<p>Give me, O Lord, purity of lips, a clean and
innocent heart, and rectitude of action. Give me
humility, patience, abstinence, chastity, prudence,
justice, fortitude, temperance. Give me the spirit
of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel
and strength, the spirit of knowledge and
godliness, and of Thy fear. Make me ever to
seek Thy face with all my heart, all my soul, all
my mind; grant me to have a contrite and
humbled heart in Thy presence&mdash;to prefer nothing
to Thy love. Most high, eternal, and ineffable
Wisdom, drive away from me the darkness of
blindness and ignorance; most high and eternal
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
Strength, deliver me; most high and eternal
Fortitude, assist me; most high and incomprehensible
Light, illuminate me; most high and
infinite Mercy, have mercy on me. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;A Gallican Sacramentary</span></p>
<h3>For Help to All</h3>
<p>[O God,] give perfection to beginners, give
intelligence to the little ones, give aid to those
who are running their course. Give compunction
to the negligent, give fervor of spirit to the
lukewarm, give to the perfect a good consummation.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;A Gallican Sacramentary</span></p>
<h3>For Mercy</h3>
<p>O Lord, who didst give to Thine Apostles
peace, shed down upon us all Thy holy calm;
gather together with Thy hand all those who
are scattered, and bring them like sheep into
the fold of Thy holy Church, through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>Strengthen and confirm me, O Lord, by Thy
Cross, on the rock of faith, that my mind be not
shaken by the attacks of the enemy. For Thou
alone art holy.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, O Lord, how many and great
are my sins, Thou knowest how often I sin,
from day to day, from hour to hour, in the
things I do and the things I leave undone. No
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
more, O Lord, no more, O Lord my God, will I
provoke Thee; no more shall my desire be for
anything but Thee, for Thou alone art truly
lovable. And if again I offend in anything, I
humbly beseech Thee of Thy mercy to grant
me strength to find favour again in Thy sight
and to live in a manner more pleasing to Thee.

<h3>For Unity</h3>
<p>O God the Father, origin of Divinity, good
beyond all that is good, fair beyond all that is
fair, in whom is calmness, peace, and concord;
do Thou make up the dissensions which divide
us from each other, and bring us back into a
unity of love, which may bear some likeness to
Thy divine nature. And as Thou art above all
things, make us one by the unanimity of a good
mind, that through the embrace of charity and
the bonds of affection, we may be spiritually one,
as well in ourselves as in each other; through that
peace of Thine which maketh all things peaceful,
and through the grace, mercy, and tenderness of
Thy Son, Jesus Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Help</h3>
<p>O Thou who art the everlasting Essence of
things beyond space and time and yet within
them; Thou who transcendest yet pervadest all
things, manifest Thyself unto us, feeling after
Thee, seeking Thee in the shades of ignorance.
Stretch forth Thy hand to help us, who cannot
without Thee come to Thee; and reveal Thyself
unto us, who seek nothing beside Thee; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h3>For Strength and Guidance</h3>
<p>Lord God Almighty, shaper and ruler of all
creatures, we pray Thee for Thy great mercy,
that Thou guide us better than we have done,
towards Thee, and guide us to Thy will, to the
need of our soul, better than we can ourselves.
And steadfast our mind towards Thy will and to
our soul&rsquo;s need. And strengthen us against the
temptations of the devil, and put far from us all
lust, and every unrighteousness, and shield us
against our foes, seen and unseen. And teach
us to do Thy will, that we may inwardly love
Thee before all things, with a pure mind. For
Thou art our maker and our redeemer, our help,
our comfort, our trust, our hope; praise and glory
be to Thee now, ever and ever, world without
end. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>An Acknowledgment of God&rsquo;s Supremacy</h3>
<p>O Thou who art the Father of that Son which
hast awakened us, and yet urgest us out of the
sleep of our sins, and exhortest us that we become
Thine, to Thee, Lord, we pray, who art
the supreme truth, for all truth that is, is from
Thee. Thee we implore, O Lord, who art the
highest wisdom, through Thee are wise, all those
that are so. Thou art the supreme joy, and from
Thee all have become happy that are so. Thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
art the highest good, and from Thee all beauty
springs. Thou art the intellectual light, and from
Thee man derives his understanding. To Thee,
O God, we call and speak. Hear us, O Lord, for
Thou art our God and our Lord, our father and
our creator, our ruler and our hope, our wealth
and our honour, our home, our country, our
salvation, and our life; hear, hear us, O Lord.
Few of Thy servants comprehend Thee, but at
least we love Thee&mdash;yea, love Thee above all
other things. We seek Thee, we follow Thee,
we are ready to serve Thee; under Thy power we
desire to abide, for Thou art the Sovereign of
all. We pray Thee to command us as Thou wilt;
through Jesus Christ Thy Son our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Forgiveness</h3>
<p>We implore the mercy of Thy Majesty, that
it may please Thee to give to us Thy servants,
pardon of our sins, that we, being delivered from
all the bonds of the enemy, may cleave to Thy
commandments with our whole heart, and evermore
love Thee alone, with all our strength, and
one day be counted worthy to attain to the sight
of Thy blessedness. Through Jesus Christ our

<h3>For Pardon, Grace, and Guidance</h3>
<p>O Thou plenteous source of every good and
perfect gift, shed abroad the cheering light of
Thy sevenfold grace over our hearts. Yea, Spirit
of love and gentleness, we most humbly implore
Thy assistance. Thou knowest our faults, our
failings, our necessities, the dulness of our understanding,
the waywardness of our affections, the
perverseness of our will. When, therefore, we
neglect to practise what we know, visit us, we
beseech Thee, with Thy grace, enlighten our
minds, rectify our desires, correct our wanderings,
and pardon our omissions, so that by Thy guidance
we may be preserved from making shipwreck
of faith, and keep a good conscience, and may
at length be landed safe in the haven of
eternal rest; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Anselm</span></p>
<h3>For the Afflicted and Distressed</h3>
<p>We bring before Thee, O Lord, the troubles
and perils of people and nations, the sighing of
prisoners and captives, the sorrows of the bereaved,
the necessities of strangers, the helplessness
of the weak, the despondency of the weary,
the failing powers of the aged. O Lord, draw
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
near to each; for the sake of Jesus Christ our
Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Anselm</span></p>
<h3>For Blessedness</h3>
<p>O God, Thou art life, wisdom, truth, bounty,
and blessedness, the Eternal, the only true Good!
My God and my Lord, Thou art my hope and
my heart&rsquo;s joy. I confess, with thanksgiving, that
Thou hast made me in Thine image, that I may
direct all my thoughts to Thee, and love Thee.
Lord, make me to know Thee aright, that I may
more and more love, and enjoy, and possess Thee.
And since, in the life here below, I cannot fully
attain this blessedness, let it at least grow in me
day by day, until it all be fulfilled at last in the
life to come. Here be the knowledge of Thee
increased, and there let it be perfected. Here let
my love to Thee grow, and there let it ripen; that
my joy being here great in hope, may there in
fruition be made perfect. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Heavenly-Mindedness</h3>
<p>O merciful God, fill our hearts, we pray Thee,
with the graces of Thy Holy Spirit, with love,
joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance. Teach us to love
those who hate us, to pray for those who despitefully
use us, that we may be the children of Thee
our Father, who makest Thy sun to shine on the
evil and on the good, and sendest rain on the
just and on the unjust. In adversity grant us
grace to be patient; in prosperity keep us humble;
may we guard the door of our lips; may we lightly
esteem the pleasures of this world, and thirst
after heavenly things; through Jesus Christ our
Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For the Presence of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>O holy Paraclete, sweetest consolation of the
sorrowful, gracious Spirit come down at this time

dark retreat, and enrich all with the dew of Thine
abundant comfort. Kindle our inward parts with
holy favour, that the incense of our prayers and
praises may ever go up to Thee, O our God;
through Jesus Christ Thy Son our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3>For Zeal</h3>
<p>O almighty and merciful Father, who pourest
Thy benefits upon us, forgive the unthankfulness
with which we have requited Thy goodness. We
have remained before Thee with dead and senseless
hearts, unkindled with love of Thy gentle
and enduring goodness. Turn Thou us, O merciful
Father, and so shall we be turned. Make us
with our whole heart to hunger and thirst after
Thee, and with all our longing to desire Thee.
Make us with our whole heart to serve Thee alone
and with all our zeal to seek those things which
are well-pleasing in Thy sight; for the sake of
Thine only begotten Son, to whom with Thee
and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, for
ever and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<p>O Lord our God, grant us grace to desire Thee

love Thee; and loving Thee we may hate those
sins from which Thou hast redeemed us; for the
sake of Jesus Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Holy Week</h3>
<p>O Father, most merciful, who in the beginning
didst create us, and by the passion of Thine only
begotten Son hast created us anew, work in us
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
now, we beseech Thee, both to will and to do
of Thy good pleasure. And forasmuch as we are
weak, and can do no good thing of ourselves,
grant us Thy grace and heavenly benediction,
that in whatsoever work we engage we may
do all to Thy honour and glory; and that, being
kept from sin and daily increasing in good works,
so long as we live in the body we may ever show
forth some service to Thee; and after our departure
may receive pardon of all our sins, and
attain eternal life; through Him who, with Thee
and the Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth for ever
and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Perfection</h3>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, our redemption and our
salvation, we praise Thee and give Thee thanks;
and though we be unworthy of Thy benefits, and
cannot offer unto Thee due devotion, yet let Thy
loving-kindness fill up that which our weakness
endeavoureth. Before Thee, O Lord, is all our
desire, and whatsoever our heart rightly willeth,
it is of Thy gift. Grant that we may attain to
love Thee even as Thou commandest. Let not
Thy gift be unfruitful in us. Perfect that Thou
hast begun, give that which Thou hast made us
to long after, convert Thou our lukewarmness
into fervent love of Thee; for the glory of Thy
holy name. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Absent Friends</h3>
<p>O blessed Lord and Saviour, who hast commanded
us to love one another, grant us grace
that, having received Thine undeserved bounty,
we may love every man in Thee and for Thee.
We beseech Thy blessing for all; but especially
for the friends whom Thy love hast given to us.
Love Thou them, O Thou fountain of love, and
make them to love Thee with all their heart, with
all their mind, and with all their soul, that those
things only which are pleasing to Thee they may
will, and speak, and do. And though our prayer
is cold, because our charity is so little fervent, yet
Thou art rich in mercy. Measure not to them
Thy goodness by the dulness of our devotion;
but as Thy kindness surpasseth all human affection,
so let Thy hearing transcend our prayer.
Do Thou to them what is expedient for them,
according to Thy will, that they, being always
and everywhere ruled and protected by Thee,
may attain in the end to everlasting life; and to
Thee, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, be all
honour and praise for ever and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Strength and Power</h3>

<p>Almighty God and heavenly Father, who of
Thine infinite love and goodness towards us,
hast given to us Thy only and most dearly beloved
Son, Jesus Christ, to be our redeemer and
the author of everlasting life, who, after He made
perfect our redemption, by His death and was
ascended into heaven, sent abroad into the world
His apostles, prophets, evangelists, doctors, and
pastors; by whose labour and ministry He
gathered together a great flock from all parts of
the world, to set forth the eternal praise of Thy

hearty thanks. We praise and worship Thee, and

<h3>Need for Heavenly Refreshment</h3>
<p>[O God,] my heart is a vain heart, a vagabond
and instable heart; while it is led by its own judgment,
and wanting divine counsel, cannot subsist
in itself; and whilst it divers ways seekest not,
findeth none, but remaineth miserable through
labor, and void of peace: it agreeth not with itself,
it dissenteth from itself, it altereth resolutions,
changeth the judgment, frameth new
thoughts, pulleth down the old, and buildeth
them up again: it willeth and willeth not; and
never remaineth in the same state.</p>
<p>Come, Holy Spirit, and bring from heaven a
ray of Thy light! Come, Thou father of the poor,
Thou giver of gifts, Thou light of the world, the
blessed Comforter, the dear guest of the soul,
and its sweetest refreshment; Thou, our repose
in labor, our coolness in heat, our comfort in
affliction! O, most blessed Spirit, fill full the
hearts of Thy faithful people! Without Thy
influence there is nothing in man which is not
weakness and guilt. O, cleanse that which is
sordid; bedew that which is dried up; heal that
which is wounded; bend that which is stubborn,
cherish in Thy bosom that which is cold; guide
that which is wandering; and grant unto Thy
servants, putting their trust in Thee, the merit of
Thy righteousness; grant them final salvation;
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>

<h3>The Daily Prayer of St. Francis</h3>
<p>My God, and my all, who art Thou, sweetest
Lord, my God? And who am I, a poor worm,
Thy servant? Holiest Lord, I would love Thee!
Sweetest Lord, I would love Thee! Lord, my
God, I give to Thee all my heart and body, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
vehemently desire, if I might know how, to do
more for Thy love. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Francis of Assisi</span></p>
<h3>Praise</h3>
<p>Now to that God, who has suffered so much
for us, who at one giving has conferred on us
so many good things, and will yet confer so many
more, to this God let every creature who is in
heaven or upon the earth, in the sea or in the
depth of the abyss, render praise, glory, honour
and blessing. He is himself our virtue and our
strength. He alone is good, lofty, almighty, admirable,
and glorious; the only holy, worthy of
praise and blessed through ages of ages. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Francis of Assisi</span></p>
<h3>For the Knowledge of God&rsquo;s Will</h3>
<p>God, almighty, eternal, righteous, and merciful,
give to us poor sinners to do for Thy sake all
that we know of Thy will, and to will always
what pleases Thee, so that inwardly purified,
enlightened, and kindled by the fire of the Holy
Spirit, we may follow in the footprints of Thy
well-beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Francis of Assisi</span></p>
<h3>Thanksgiving</h3>
<p>Almighty, most holy, most high and supreme
God, holy and just Father, Lord, king of heaven
and earth, for Thyself we give thanks to Thee
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
because by Thy holy will, and by Thine only
Son, Thou hast created all things spiritual and
corporal in the Holy Ghost and didst place us
made to Thine image and likeness in paradise,
whence we fell by our own fault. And we give
Thee thanks because, as by Thy Son Thou didst
create us, so by the true and holy love with
which Thou hast loved us, Thou didst cause
Him, true God and true man, to be born....
And we give thanks to Thee because Thy Son
Himself is to come again in the glory of His
Majesty ... to say to all who have known Thee
and adored Thee, and served Thee in repentance:
&ldquo;Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess the
Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of
the world.&rdquo; And since all we wretches and sinners
are not worthy to name Thee, we humbly beseech
Thee, that our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy
beloved Son, in whom Thou art well pleased,
together with the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete,
may give thanks to Thee as it is pleasing to Thee
and Them, for all. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Francis of Assisi</span></p>
<h3>Praise and Guidance</h3>
<p>Almighty, most holy, most high, and supreme
God, highest good, all good, wholly good, who
alone art good, to Thee we render all praise, all
glory, all thanks, all honor, all blessing, and we
shall always refer all good to Thee.</p>
<p>Almighty, eternal, just, and merciful God,
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
give to us wretches to do for Thee what we know
Thee to will and to will always that which is
pleasing to Thee; so that inwardly purified, inwardly
illumined and kindled by the flame of
the Holy Ghost, we may be able to follow in
the footsteps of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
and by Thy grace alone come to Thee the Most
High, who in perfect Trinity and simple unity

<h3>For the Brothers</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus, Thou didst choose Thine apostles
to the number of twelve, and if one of them
did betray Thee, the others, remaining united
to Thee, preached Thy holy Gospel, filled with
one and the same inspiration; and behold now,
remembering the former days, Thou hast raised
up the Religion of the Brothers in order to uphold
faith, and that by them the mystery of Thy
Gospel may be accomplished. Who will take
their place if, instead of fulfilling their mission
and being shining examples for all, they are
seen to give themselves up to the works of
darkness? <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Thy Love</h3>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord, that the fiery and
sweet strength of Thy love may absorb my soul
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
from all things that are under heaven, that I may
die for love of Thy love as Thou didst deign to
die for the love of my love. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Francis of Assisi</span></p>
<h3>Thanksgiving</h3>
<p>Thanks be to Thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, for
all the benefits which Thou hast given us; for all
the pains and insults which Thou hast borne
for us. O most merciful Redeemer, friend and
brother, may we know Thee more clearly, love
Thee more dearly, and follow Thee more nearly;
for Thine own sake. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>Daily Prayer</h3>

<p>Thou, O Christ, art the King of glory; Thou
art the everlasting Son of the Father. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas Aquinas</span></p>
<h3>For Steadfastness</h3>
<p>Grant me, I beseech Thee, almighty and most
merciful God, fervently to desire, wisely to search
out, and perfectly to fulfill, all that is well-pleasing
unto Thee. Order Thou my worldly condition
to the glory of Thy name; and, of all that Thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
requirest me to do, grant me the knowledge, the
desire, and the ability, that I may so fulfill it as
I ought, and may my path to Thee, I pray, be
safe, straightforward, and perfect to the end.</p>
<p>Give me, O Lord, a steadfast heart, which no
unworthy affection may drag downwards; give me
an unconquered heart, which no tribulation can
wear out; give me an upright heart, which no
unworthy purpose may tempt aside.</p>
<p>Bestow upon me also, O Lord my God, understanding
to know Thee, diligence to seek Thee,
wisdom to find Thee, and a faithfulness that may
finally embrace Thee. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas Aquinas</span></p>
<h3>For Love of Jesus</h3>
<p>Ah! sweet Jesus, pierce the marrow of my soul
with the healthful shafts of Thy love, that it
may truly burn, and melt, and languish, with
the only desire of Thee; that it may desire to be
dissolved, and to be with Thee; let it hunger
alone for the bread of life: let it thirst after
Thee, the spring and fountain of eternal light,
the stream of true pleasure; let it always desire
Thee, seek Thee, and find Thee, and sweetly
rest in Thee. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Bonaventura</span></p>
<h3>For Pardon, Purity, and Grace</h3>
<p>O Holy God, in whom is all goodness, whose
pity and mercy made Thee to descend from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
high throne down into this world, the valley of
woe and weeping, and here to take our nature,
and in that nature to suffer pain and death, to
bring our souls to Thy Kingdom. Merciful Lord,
forgive us all our sins that we have done, thought,
and said. O glorious Trinity, send us cleanness of
heart and purity of soul; restore us with Thy
Holy Spirit, and strengthen us with Thy might,
that we may always withstand evil temptations.
Comfort us with Thy Holy Ghost, and fulfill us
with grace and charity, that we may henceforth
live virtuously and love Thee with all our heart,
with all our might, and with all our soul, so that
we may never offend Thee, but ever follow Thy
pleasure in will, word, thought, and deed. Now
grant us this, good Lord, that art infinite, which
eternally shall endure; through Jesus Christ Thy
Son. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>A Memorial of the Resurrection</h3>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ, by Thy glorious resurrection,
in which Thou didst appear alive and immortal
to Thy disciples and faithful followers,
by Thy forty days&rsquo; abiding and sweet converse,
in which by many infallible proofs, speaking of
things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, Thou
didst comfort them and assure them of Thine
actual resurrection, removing all doubt from their
hearts. We beseech Thee, O Lord, grant that we
may be numbered among those who were fore-ordained
by God to be witnesses of Thy resurrection,

<h3>For Heavenly-Mindedness</h3>
<p>O most blessed Lord, deign to help us, and of
Thy great mercy abolish our sins; detach our
minds from earthly things, and raise them to the
love of heavenly riches. Most merciful God, who
dost favour all true love, do Thou so aid and
direct us that we may love Thee above all things,
and recognizing Thine infinite benefits, may
keep them in memory, and give Thee everlasting
thanks for them. Finally, grant that ours may
be the blessed life which shall enjoy Thy love for

<h3>Self-Renunciation</h3>
<p>If a man may attain thereunto, to be unto God
as his hand is unto man, let him be therewith

<p>That we may thus deny ourselves, and forsake
and renounce all things for God&rsquo;s sake, and
give up our own wills, and die unto ourselves,
and live unto God alone and to his will, may
He help us who gave up His will to His heavenly

blessing for ever and ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>The God We Love</h3>
<p>Now, he who will hold to God, loves all things
in the One which is One and All; and the One
in All, because All is in the One; and he who
loves somewhat, this or that, otherwise than in
the One, and for the sake of the One, loves not
God; for he loves somewhat which is not God,
therefore he loves it more than God. But he who
loves somewhat more than God, or equally with
God, loves not God; for God must be and will
be alone loved, and in truth nothing ought to be
loved but God alone. And when the True Light
and the True divine Love dwell in a man, he
loves nothing else but God alone. For he loves
God as the Good, and for the sake of the Good,
and all Goods as One, and One as All. For,
verily, All is One and One is All in God. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>The Quiet Hour</h3>
<p>Lord, I offer unto Thee all my sins and
offences, which I have committed before Thee,
from the day wherein I first could sin even to
this hour; that Thou mayest consume and burn
them, one and all, with the fire of Thy love, and
do away all the stains of my sins, and cleanse
my conscience from all offences, and restore to
me Thy grace, fully forgiving me all, and admitting
me mercifully to the kiss of peace. I offer
up also unto Thee all that is good in me, though
it be very small and imperfect, in order that Thou
mayest amend and sanctify it, that Thou mayest
make it grateful and acceptable unto Thee, and
always be perfecting it more and more; and bring
me also, slothful and unprofitable poor creature
as I am, to a good and blessed end. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Faithful and Prepared Lives</h3>
<p>Who can tell what a day may bring forth?
Cause us, therefore, gracious God, to live every
day as if it were to be our last, for that we know
not but it may be such. Cause us to live so at
present as we shall wish we had done when we
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
come to die. O grant that we may not die with
any guilt upon our consciences, or any known
sin unrepented of, but that we may be found in
Christ, who is our only Saviour and Redeemer.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>Let Thy Will Be Mine</h3>
<p>O most merciful Lord, grant to me Thy grace,
that it may be with me, and labor with me, and
persevere with me even to the end. Grant that I
may always desire and will that which is to Thee
most acceptable, and most dear. Let Thy will be
mine, and my will ever follow Thine, and agree
perfectly with it. Grant to me, above all things
that can be desired, to rest in Thee, and in Thee
to have my heart at peace. Thou art the true
peace of the heart, Thou its only rest; out of
Thee all things are hard and restless. In this very
peace, that is, in Thee, the one Chiefest Eternal
Good, I will sleep and rest. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>Praise</h3>
<p>I will say unto my God, my Lord, and my
King, &ldquo;O how great is the abundance of Thy
goodness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up
for them that fear Thee.&rdquo; But what art Thou
to those who love Thee? What to those who
serve Thee with their whole heart? In this especially
Thou hast showed me the sweetness of
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Thy love; that, when I was not, Thou madest
me, when I went far astray from Thee, Thou
broughtest me back again, that I might serve
Thee, and hast commanded me to love Thee. I
would I were able, at least for one day, to do
Thee some worthy service. Truly, Thou art my
Lord, and I Thy servant, who am bound to serve
Thee with all my might; and this I wish to do,
this I desire; and whatsoever is wanting unto
me, do Thou, I beseech Thee, vouchsafe to
supply. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>Thy Will Be Done</h3>
<p>O Lord, Thou knowest what is best for us,
let this or that be done, as Thou shalt please.
Give what Thou wilt, and how much Thou wilt,
and when Thou wilt. Deal with me as Thou
thinkest good, and as best pleaseth Thee. Set
me where Thou wilt, and deal with me in all
things just as Thou wilt. Behold, I am Thy
servant, prepared for all things; for I desire not
to live unto myself, but unto Thee; and Oh,
that I could do it worthily and perfectly! <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>My Hope and Refuge</h3>
<p>Ah, Lord God, Thou holy Lover of my soul,
when Thou comest into my soul, all that is
within me shall rejoice. Thou art my Glory and
the exultation of my heart; Thou art my hope
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
and refuge in the day of my trouble. Set me
free from all evil passions, and heal my heart of
all inordinate affections; that, being inwardly
cured and thoroughly cleansed, I may be made
fit to love, courageous to suffer, steady to persevere.
Nothing is sweeter than love, nothing
more courageous, nothing fuller nor better in
heaven and earth; because love is born of God,
and cannot rest but in God, above all created
things. Let me love Thee more than myself, nor
love myself but for Thee; and in Thee all that
truly love Thee, as the law of love commandeth,
shining out from Thyself. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>

<h3>For Others</h3>
<p>I offer up unto Thee my prayers and intercessions,
for those especially who have in any
matter hurt, grieved, or found fault with me, or
who have done me any damage or displeasure.</p>
<p>For all those also whom, at any time, I may
have vexed, troubled, burdened, and scandalized,
by words or deeds, knowingly or in ignorance;
that Thou wouldst grant us all equally pardon
for our offences against each other.</p>
<p>Take away from our hearts, O Lord, all
suspiciousness, indignation, wrath, and contention,
and whatsoever may hurt charity, and
lessen brotherly love.</p>
<p>Have mercy, O Lord, have mercy on those
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
that crave Thy mercy, give grace unto them that
stand in need thereof, and make us such as that
we may be worthy to enjoy Thy grace, and go
forward to life eternal. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>To Do Thy Will</h3>
<p>O Lord, my God, Thou art to me whatsoever
is good. Remember me because I am nothing, I
have nothing, and I can do nothing. Thou alone
art good, just, and holy; Thou canst do all
things, Thou accomplishest all things, Thou
fillest all things. Remember Thy mercies, and
fill my heart with Thy grace, Thou who wilt not
that Thy works should be void and in vain.
Turn not Thy face away from me; withdraw not
Thy consolation, lest my soul become as a
thirsty land to Thee. Teach me, O Lord, to do
Thy will; teach me to live worthily and humbly
in Thy sight. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>My Salvation and My Redemption</h3>
<p>In confidence of Thy goodness and great
mercy, O Lord, I draw near unto Thee, as a sick
person to the healer, as one hungry and thirsty
to the fountain of life, a creature to the creator,
a desolate soul to my own tender comforter.
Behold, in Thee is all whatsoever I can or ought
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
to desire; Thou art my salvation and my redemption,
my hope and my strength. Rejoice
therefore this day the soul of Thy servant; for
unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
<span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>For the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>Strengthen me, O God, by the grace of Thy
Holy Spirit. Grant me to be strengthened with
might in the inner man, and to empty my heart
of all useless care and anguish. O Lord, grant me
heavenly wisdom, that I may learn above all
things to seek and to find Thee, above all things
to relish and to love Thee, and to think of all
other things as being, what indeed they are, at
the disposal of Thy wisdom. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>For Thee, O Lord</h3>
<p>Lord, what is my confidence which I have in
this life? Is it not Thou, O Lord, my God, whose
mercies are without number? Where hath it
ever been well with me without Thee, or where
could it be ill with me, when Thou wert
present? I rather choose to be a pilgrim on
earth, than without Thee to possess heaven.
Where Thou art, there is heaven; and where
Thou art not, there is death and hell. There is
none that can help me in my necessities, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
only Thou, my God; Thou art my hope, Thou
my confidence. Although Thou exposest me to
divers temptations and adversities, yet Thou
orderest all this to my advantage; in which trial
of me Thou oughtest no less to be loved and
praised, than if Thou didst fill me full of heavenly
consolations. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>For Consolation</h3>
<p>O Thou most sweet and loving Lord, Thou
knowest mine infirmities, and the necessities
which I endure; in how great evils and sins I
am involved; how often I am weighed down,
tempted, and disturbed by them. I entreat of
Thee consolation and support. I speak to Thee
who knowest all things, to whom all my inward
thoughts are open, and who alone canst perfectly
comfort and help me. Thou knowest what
things I stand in most need of. Behold, I stand
before Thee poor and naked, calling for grace,
and imploring mercy. Refresh Thy hungry
supplicant, kindle my coldness with the fire of
Thy love, enlighten my blindness with the
brightness of Thy presence. Suffer me not to
go away from Thee hungry and dry, but deal
mercifully with me, as often times Thou hast
dealt wonderfully with Thy saints. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h3>For Trust in Thee</h3>
<p>O Lord my God, be not Thou far from me; my
God, have regard to help me; for there have risen
up against me sundry thoughts, and great fears,
afflicting my soul. How shall I pass through
unhurt? How shall I break them to pieces? This
is my hope, my one only consolation, to flee
unto Thee in every tribulation, to trust in Thee,
to call upon Thee from my inmost heart, and to
wait patiently for Thy consolation. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>For the Comforter</h3>
<p>Write Thy blessed name, O Lord, upon my
heart, there to remain so indelibly engraven,
that no prosperity, no adversity shall ever move
me from Thy love. Be Thou to me a strong
tower of defence, a comforter in tribulation, a
deliverer in distress, a very present help in
trouble, and a guide to heaven through the many
temptations and dangers of this life. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>For Love of God and His Laws</h3>
<p>O most gracious God, from whom every good
and perfect gift cometh, we beseech Thee to
work in us both to will and to do according to
Thy good pleasure. Enlighten our minds that we
may know Thee, and let us not be unfruitful in
that knowledge. Lord, work in our hearts a true
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
faith, a purifying hope, and an unfeigned love
towards Thee. Give us a full trust in Thee, zeal
for Thee, reverence of all things that relate to
Thee. Make us fearful to offend Thee, thankful
for Thy mercies, humble under Thy corrections,
devout in Thy service, and sorrowful for our
sins. Grant that in all things we may behave
ourselves so as befits a creature to his Creator,
a servant to his Lord. Make us diligent in all
our duties, watchful against all temptations,
pure and temperate and moderate in Thy most
lawful enjoyments, that they may never become
a snare to us. Help us, O Lord, to act towards
our neighbour that we may never transgress
the royal law of Thine, of loving him as ourselves.
Finally, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to
sanctify us throughout, that our whole spirit,
soul, and body, may be preserved blameless unto
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom
with Thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour
and glory for ever. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>For Consecration</h3>
<p>Almighty God, who hast made all things for
man, and man for Thy glory, sanctify our body
and soul, our thoughts and our intentions, our
words and actions, that whatsoever we shall
think, or speak or do, may by us be designed to
the glorification of Thy name, and by Thy
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
blessing, it may be effectual and successful in
the work of God, according as it can be capable.
Lord, turn necessities into virtues, the works of
Nature into the works of grace, by making them
orderly, regular and temperate, subordinate and
profitable to ends beyond their own proper
efficacy; and let no pride or self-seeking, no impure
motive, or unworthy purpose, no little ends,
and low imagination stain our spirit, and unhallow
any of our words and actions. But let our
body be a servant to our spirit, and both body
and spirit servants of Jesus Christ, that doing
all things for Thy glory here, we may be partakers
of Thy glory hereafter; through Jesus
Christ. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<h3>For Friends</h3>
<p>Almighty, everlasting God, have mercy on
Thy servants our friends. Keep them continually
under Thy protection, and direct them according
to Thy gracious favour in the way of everlasting
salvation; that they may desire such things as
please Thee, and with all their strength perform
the same. And forasmuch as they trust in Thy
mercy, vouchsafe, O Lord, graciously to assist
them with Thy heavenly help, that they may
ever diligently serve Thee, and by no temptations
be separated from Thee; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. <span class="sc">Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="lr">&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Kempis</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h3>For Thy Spirit</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The prayers I make will then be sweet indeed,</p>
<p class="t0">If Thou the spirit give by which I pray;</p>
<p class="t0">My unassisted heart is barren clay,</p>
<p class="t0">That of its native self can nothing feed;</p>
<p class="t0">Of good and pious works Thou art the seed</p>
